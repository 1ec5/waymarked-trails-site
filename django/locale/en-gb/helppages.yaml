about:
  osm: |-
    The routes are overlayed on the standard OpenStreetMap and optionally a hillshading layer. The route map is generated from
    data from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM)
    project. OSM is a freely editable world map where anybody can
    participate. Which means that it is by no means complete,
    but it also means that you can contribute by adding new routes and
    correcting mistakes in existing ones. To find out more about
    OpenStreetMap, see the
    [Beginner's guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_Guide).
rendering:
  mtbroutes: |-
    Mountain-biking routes follow the same tagging schema as cycling routes
    which is described in detail on the OSM wiki page about
    [cycling routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cycle_routes).
    Relations that have the following tags are recognised as MTB routes:

        type = route|superroute
        route = mtb

    Regular cycling routes are displayed on the [cycling map](http://cycling.waymarkedtrails.org/en/).
  skatingroutes: |-
    Sign-posted skating routes should be tagged like any other route relation.
    For the tagging understood by this map, have a look at the wiki page about
    [Swiss inline skating routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Switzerland/InlineNetwork).
    To be recognised as a skating route, the following tags need to be present:

        type = route|superroute
        route = inline_skates
  ridingroutes: |-
    Sign-posted horse riding routes should be tagged like any other route relation.
    For details see [the route page in the OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:route).
    To be recognized as a horse riding route, the following tags need to be present:

        type = route|superroute
        route = horse
  sloperoutes: |-
    Sign-posted slopes are ways with the piste:type tags.
    To be recognised as a slope, the following tags need to be present for ways:

        piste:type = downhill|nordic|sled|hike|sleigh

    For relations, the following tags need to be present:

        type = route|superroute
        route = ski|piste
        piste:type = downhill|nordic|sled|hike|sleigh
  slopeclassification: |-
    The classification of ski (downhill) slopes is
    determined from the `piste:difficulty` tag, and used
    for the colour in the rendering.
  classification: |-
    A `route` tag with multiple values is supported when they are separated by
    semicolon without any surrounding spaces.
    The classification (and therefore the colour of the route in the map) is
    determined from the `network` tag.
  hikinglabels: |-
    The label for each route is "guessed" from the tags in the following order:

    1. Check for [localised rendering rules](rendering/hikinglocal).
    2. Try to interpret the `osmc:symbol` tag. For details about which parts
       are understood, see [osmc:symbol rendering rules](rendering/osmc).
    3. If a `ref` tag exists, make a text label with the `ref` tag.
    4. If a `name` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using
       only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters
       of the name.
    5. Give up.
  guideposts: |-
    [Guideposts](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:information%3Dguidepost)
    are recognised by the following tags:

        tourism=information
        information=guidepost
        name=<name>
        ele=<altitude>

    `tourism` and `information` are mandatory. `name` and `ele` can be omitted.
osmc:
  text: |-
    The `osmc:symbol` tag provides a way to describe in a machine-readable way
    route symbols in simple geometric shapes like they are found in some
    European countries (and especially in Germany). The map only
    supports a subset of what is described on the Wiki page. In order to
    be rendered on the map, the tag must have the following format:

        osmc:symbol=waycolor:background:foreground:text:textcolor

    `waycolor` must be there but is ignored for this map. `foreground` may not
    be empty, a second foreground is not supported. `text` and `textcolor` can
    be omitted. There is a
    [list of foreground and background symbols rendered in this map](osmc_legende)
    available.

    *Note:* the older version of the map accepted the `foreground` part to
    be empty. This is no longer supported because the `osmc:symbol` tag
    should only be used to describe geometric shapes. Without the foreground
    shape, the symbol describes a simple reference of the way and, for the
    sake of clarity will be rendered as such. Local exceptions may be possible.
hikinglocal:
  title: Localised rendering
  text: |-
    There are a lot of different systems to mark hiking paths around the world. While the
    map attempts to use the most general tags to give them a decent rendering, it is
    bound to fail for certain systems, especially for networks of hiking paths. To
    accommodate these systems, the map can be localised for regions where the
    standard rendering is insufficient.

    Below is a list of regions that use special map symbols. In order to have your
    own region rendered in a special way, read the hints at the end of the page.
  czech: |-
    ## Czech Republic

    The country uses a trail marking standard based on a set of 7 symbols in 4 different
    colours. For a description see the [Czech tagging page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Czech_Republic/Editing_Standards_and_Conventions#Doporu.C4.8Den.C3.A9_typy_cest) (Czech only).

    When a `kct_*` tag is available it is preferred over any `osmc:symbol` tag.
    In addition, the route is reclassified if no valid network tag can be found. Routes
    with `kct_red=major` become national routes, other `kct_*=major` are classified as
    regional.
  hungary: |-
    ## Hungary

    Hungary also use a system with a fixed set of symbols in different colours. These
    are marked with their own tag [jel](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:jel).
    The tag is preferred over any `osmc:symbol` tag.
  ukcycle: |-
    ## United Kingdom

    ### Norwich

    Norwich uses a system of colour-coded routes. Routes tagged with
    `operator=Norwich City Council` are marked with a coloured square according
    to the `colour` tag.
elevationprofiles:
  general: |-
    The elevation profiles are made with elevation data from the [ASTER global digital elevation model (GDEM) version 2](http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp), the "ele" tag in OpenStreetMap is not taken into account, nor are tunnels and bridges. ASTER GDEM is a product of METI and NASA.

    If the route has more than two end points or consists of more than one segment, no profile will be rendered. The direction of the profile follows the route west-east or north-south. If routes had elements with roles such as "start" and "goal", and/or were listed continuously from start to goal, we might be able determine direction from the route relation itself. You might want to bear those things in mind if mapping routes on OpenStreetMap.

    There are holes, so called "voids" for which we have no elevation data, these are visualised with holes in the elevation profile line.

    Beware that while ASTER version 2 is probably the best free global DEM, it does have its limitations both when it comes to accuracy and coverage, see their [validation summary report](http://www.jspacesystems.or.jp/ersdac/GDEM/ver2Validation/Summary_GDEM2_validation_report_final.pdf) for more information. The inaccuracies are further exacerbated by the inaccuracy of the OSM data, [a smoothing technique](https://github.com/lonvia/waymarked-trails-site/commit/602e12f38bfdc50c7e07bd3f44e080d72bcbb2a2) that we apply, and the resolution of the profile which becomes lower the longer the route is.
