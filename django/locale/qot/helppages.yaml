    hiking: |
        This map shows sign-posted hiking routes around the world. 
    osm: |
        It is based
        on data from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM) 
        project. OSM is a freely editable world map where anybody can 
        participate. That means that this hiking map is by no means complete, 
        but it also means that you can contribute by adding new routes and 
        correcting mistakes in existing ones. To find out more about 
        OpenStreetMap, see the 
        [Beginner's guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_Guide).
rendering:
    title: Rendering OSM data
    routes: |
        Hiking routes in OSM should be entered as relations. How this works is
        described in detail on the tagging page about 
        [walking routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Walking_Routes)
        in the OSM wiki. This map shows relations that have at least the 
        following tags:

            type = route|superroute
            route = foot|walking|hiking

        Which route type is given makes no difference. The classification 
        (and therefore the colour of the route in the map) is determined from the 
        `network` tag. 
    hikingsymbol: |
        The symbol is guessed from the tags in the following order:

        1. Check for [localized rendering rules](rendering/local_rules).
        2. Try to interpret the `osmc:symbol` tag. For details about which parts 
           are understood, see [osmc:symbol rendering rules](rendering/osmc_symbol).
        3. If a `ref` tag exists, make a text label with the `ref` tag.
        4. If a `name` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using 
           only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters 
           of the name. 
        5. Give up. 

    hierarchy:
        The map also supports [relation hierarchies](rendering/hierarchies).
    guideposts: |
        [Guideposts](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:information%3Dguidepost) 
        are recognized if they have the following tags:

            tourism=information
            information=guidepost
            name=<name>
            ele=<altitude>

        `tourism` and `information` are mandatory. If both `name` and `ele` are 
        missing, the guidepost will appear unnamed and gray.  
hierarchies:
    title: Relation hierarchies
    text: |
        The map also supports nested relations, i.e. relations that contain
        relations themselves. At the moment there are two main uses for such
        relation hierarchies: they are either used to split up very long routes
        (e.g. [E1](/route/European%20walking%20route%20E1)) or they are used
        to avoid duplicated work where two routes go along the same way (see
        for example, the Swiss [Via Francigena](/route/Via%20Francigena,%20Swiss%20part)
        which is part of the European [Via Romea Francigena](/route/Via%20Romea%20Francigena)). 
        In the first case the sub-relations are not complete routes 
        themselves and should therefore not be shown on a map.

        How exactly a subrelation is treated by the renderer depends on the 
        `network` tag:

        * If parent and child relation share the same network tag, the child 
          relation is taken to be just a stage of the parent relation. Thus, 
          its route is added to the parent relation and the child relation is
          not shown in the map.
        * If the network tag of parent and child relation are different, the 
          relation are assumed to be independent. The route of the child relation 
          is added to the parent and both relations are shown in the map.

        *Note:* you can always inspect subrelations via the route browser. Simply 
        select the parent relation and a selectable list of its subrelations is shown.
osmc:
    title: osmc:symbol tag
    text: |
        The osmc:symbol tag provides a way to describe in a machine-readable way 
        route symbols in simple geometric shapes like they are found in some
        European countries (and especially in Germany). The hiking map only
        supports a subset of what is described on the Wiki page. In order to
        be rendered on the map, the tag must have the following format:

            osmc:symbol=waycolor:background:foreground:text:textcolor

        Waycolor must be there but is ignored for this map. Foreground may not
        be empty, a second foreground is not supported. Text and text color can
        be omitted. There is a 
        [list of foreground and background symbols rendered in this map](../osmc_symbol_legende)
        available.

        *Note:* the older version of the map accepted the `foreground` part to
        be empty. This is no longer supported because the `osmc:symbol` tag 
        should only be used to describe geometric shapes. Without the foreground
        shape, the symbol describes a simple reference of the way and, for the
        sake of clarity will be rendered as such. Local exceptions may be possible. 

technical:
    title: Technical details
    text: |
        The overlay is updated once a day. The date in the upper left corner shows
        the last update. Normally, contributions until around midnight are taken
        into account. (Updates of the underlying Mapnik map are not within this
        site's control. Depending on the current load of the OSM server they take
        between a minute and a few days.)
